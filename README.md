# go-activecampaign

Library to work with Active Campaign. The full Active Campaign API is not implemented, but instead we will implement routes as needed for our client work. Currently you can create contacts, and tag contacts.

As our requirements change, we will implement more API routes.

The full API documentation is found here:
https://developers.activecampaign.com/reference
